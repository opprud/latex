A 90\% reduction in the emission of climate gases, is the ambitious Danish goal, presented to achieve the maximum temperature rise of 2$\,^{\circ}$C  in the global average temperature. This goal cannot solely be achieved by increasing energy taxes and optimizing energy usage, a vital mean to reduction is energy awareness. 

This article asseses some of the current attempts to reduce energyconsumption among danish energyconsumers.

In the scope of ecosense, focus will be on the opportunity to visualize energy consumption in typical households. A clear distinguishing between mandatory and leisure usage, is believed to reinforce greener habits, when presented clear and intuitive.

\textit{Keywords - awareness, visualization, smart metering, greener habits}

\section{scope}
This article is written as part of the publications within the Ecosense project. The Ecosense project is a collaboration between several Danish universities, companies and foreign research institutions. 

The common emphasis is on visualizing the individuals energy habits, and impact on the environment, aiming at reinforcing new and greener habits. 

The Ecosense project is funded by the Danish Strategic Research Council with 18 millions.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Electricity has become a necessity in all developed countries, not only in Denmark on which this article focuses. Yet with fluctuating production prices, due to a growing share being produced by renewable sources, and a long term trend of an annual increase of approximately 5 \% \cite{udv_elpriser}, still private households acounts for 20\% of the total electricity consumption in Denmark \cite{energistat}.
The danish governments ambitious goal Denmark being a pioneering nation, that must be self-sustainable, having the entire energy comsumption covered by renewable energysources by 2050 \cite{energipolitik_2020} 

The long term increase in disposable income increases to leverage the availability of electrical appliances in Danish households %\cite{keylist}. 

The increase in energy consuming appliances can be split into both leisure-usage products, such ad flat screen TV's gmaing consoles, laptops etc. labeled \textit{wants}, and on the other hand white goods and other home appliances, aiding the busy family in their daily business, labeled \textit{needs}.

.....Argue that visualization og the actual energy usage, and the distribution between \textit{needs} and \textit{wants} may actuallty stimulate awareness and interest in the actual energy usage.

...will try to present a framework for stimulation adoption of greener energy habits.1




\subsection{Current and past efforts, supporting adoption of greener habits}

\subsection{development of energyconsuming devices in households}

\section{Theoretical considerations}
Attempting to enforce new technology aided habits in a population can be described by models of technology adoption. 
Traditional approaches suggest that technology adopters gain interest in a product by acquiring it and assessing its application, hereby assimilating knowledge about it \cite{gilbert}.

\subsection{Rogers innovation adoption model}
Adoption of innovations, where innovations are defined as an idea, practice or object suited for adoption, is well described by Everett Rogers diffusion research.
Initially Rogers models \cite{rogers_model} operates with a model describing market penetration described bu an S curve, also known as the logistic function, ~\ref{fig:adoption}

Innovators &			%new line
This group is characterized by being the first individuals to adopt 
an innovation, thus this group represents only 2.5\% of the consumers \cite{diffusion2}. 
Innovators are typically members of the higher social classes, 
risk willing, has good financial lucidity, and are very social competent, 
often in close contact with other innovators. 
The innovators are seldom impacted by the fact the their risk-willingness results in an acquisition of a failed or faulty technology \cite{rogers_model} 
Innovator may even being wiling to use a technology prototype.  \\ % inserting body of the table
\hline

Early adopters & 
The early adopters are the second fastest group to adopt an innovation. What characterizes Early Adopters are a high degree of opinion leadership, compared to the other adopter groups. Innovators and early adopters are closely related in terms of education level, financial lucidity and social skills. Early adopters are a bit more judicious in their decission making regarding adoption of a new technology, compared to the innovators, thus seeking to adopt a somewhat mature technology. Their judicious approach often position early adopters in central communication positions, as opinion makers \cite{rogers_model}.
Early adopters make up about 13.5\% of the consumers \cite{diffusion2} \\
\hline

Early majority &  
This group, representing 34 \% of consumers \cite{diffusion2} are the careful consumers, avoiding the big risks, by relying on feedback from the early adopter group. 
This group seldom represents the opinion makers, but rely on feedback and recommendations from others. Their more awaiting approach to adoption results in a somewhat later time for adoption of emerging innovations\cite{rogers_model}.\\
\hline

Late majority & 
The late majority also represents app. 34\% of the consumers\cite{diffusion2}, but with a somewhat more skeptical approach. Here, only innovations that has became more common items are adopted. The late majority group is characterized, in general, by having below average social status, and only very little opinion leadership\cite{rogers_model}.\\
\hline

Laggards & 
Laggards are the remaining 16\% of customers trying to avoid changes and having to adopt new innovations. This group may not adopt a new innovation until traditional alternatives are no longer available  cs\cite{diffusion2}. Focus is very much on traditions, the group tends to have the highest age among adopters, lowest financial fluidity, and primarily only being in contact with close friends and family. Thus this group does not represent any opinion leadership\cite{rogers_model} \\

\subsection{hypothesis}
\textit{"There is a potential in visualizing energy consumption i real time, to enforce greener habits, among the groups"}

\textit{"Visualizing energy consumption in realtime, by means of IT aided solution, and focusing onpotential savings, will enforce greener habits among the energy consumers"}

\textit{"By presenting a clear distinction between leisure and nessecery usage, the consumer groups, capable of adopting this technology, will be able to to adopt a greener mindset"}

\section{model}
By using Rogers models for technology diffusion and adoption, a framework will be established to asses the impact of energy saving campaigns the in the ?5 year? period 2006-2011.
The perspective applied is from an approach where the interest is to focus on IT aided solutions used to stimulate new greener habits among consumers.

Since the emerge of new IT aided technologies for communicating,  browsing the web, collecting data and communicating via social medias has experienced a massive growth the last decade, it will be a valid assumption that these technologies will play a central role in most Danish energy consumers everyday life.

This field, in particular the emerge of smartphones, combined with collective sensing and data-sharing presents a massive potential in terms of ability to collect, share and analyse data. Much of this relies on the continuous development and emerge of new technologies, thus models for adoption of new technology, in particular \textit{Everet Rogers theory behind Diffusion of innovations will be used}.

Existing evaluation of present conducted campaigns and where possible evaluation of current activities, both with primary focus on electricity usage, will be analyzed.


\section{current and past initiatives}
Below the most significant, and regional initittives, in Denmark across the last ?? years are outlined

\subsection{Energymarking of electric products}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{energy_mark.png}
\caption{\textit{EU's energymark}}			
\label{fig:emark} % is used to refer this table in the text
\end{figure}

The EU energymark is mandatory for all producers and retailers of following household appliances: 
Fridge and freezers, Dishwashers, Washing-machines, Tumble-driers, Electric bulbs, Ovens, 
Air-conditioning and climate devices and Televisions.
The mark originally rates products from A to G, where A indicates the best energy efficiency. 
Additions allows \textbf{A+}, \textbf{A++} and \textbf{A+++} marking, if technology allows this. 

The rating is relative, to the current technological availability, for instance regarding \textit{light-bulbs}, 
here the bulbs are compared to traditional incandescent lightbulbs, today an \textbf{A}-rated buld shall produce 4 times more \textit{Lumen} per \textit{Watt} than a similar incandescent type, emitting the same amount of light. For light  bulbs the energy mark also specifies the expected lifetime in \textit{hours}.

When buying new household appliances the energy-mark is a good factual indication, that can be used to judge the
best energy efficiency, and thus biasing the customer to buy energy efficient products. 

A potential drawback of the energy mark, is the risk of a non-persistent "green-impact", since the energy-mark 
primarily is to be used during purchase. History shows that technology and alo energy efficiency improves over time, so the once purchased energymarked \textbf{A} fridge, might not be as efficient any more. The impact of the energy mark may not also not affect the users behavior, once the purchase has been made.  

The legislation regarding \textit{energy-marking of energy-related products} states that saving are to be achieved by informing the end user about consumption during usage, and other vital facts. Other vital facts could be emitted \textit{Lumens} and expected liftime in \textit{Hours} for a lightbulb. 


\textit{Keywords - efficiency, lifetime, standardization, harmonization.}

\subsection{Go' Energi}

Go' Energi is a campaign targeted at Danish Houseowners, with the aim of informing about potential improvements in indoor climate, comfort, energy economics
and climate awareness.


\textit{Keywords - inspiration, optimization, environmental conscience, act rather than think.}
