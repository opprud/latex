%\boldmath
A 90\% reduction in the emission of climate gases, is the ambitious Danish goal, presented to achieve the maximum temperature rise of 2$\,^{\circ}$C  in the global average temperature. This goal cannot solely be achieved by increasing energy taxes and optimizing energy usage, a vital mean to reduction is awareness about energy usage	. 

This article asseses some of the current attempts to reduce energyconsumption among danish energyconsumers.

The article will be written also in the scope of the Ecosense project, focus will be on the opportunity to visualize energy consumption in typical households. A clear distinguishing between mandatory and leisure usage, is believed to reinforce greener habits, when presented clear and intuitive.

\textit{Keywords - awareness, visualization, smart metering, greener habits}
\end{abstract}

\section{scope}
This article is written as part of the publications within the Ecosense project. The Ecosense project is a collaboration between several Danish universities, companies and foreign research institutions. 

The common emphasis is on visualizing the individuals energy habits, and impact on the environment, aiming at reinforcing new and greener habits. 

The Ecosense project is funded by the Danish Strategic Research Council with 18 millions.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Electricity has become a necessity in all developed countries, not only in Denmark on which this article focuses. Yet with fluctuating production prices, due to a growing share being produced by renewable sources, and a long term trend of an annual increase in electricity prices of approximately 5\% \cite{udv_elpriser}, still private households accounts for 20\% of the total electricity consumption in Denmark \cite{energistat}.

The Danish governments recent ambitious goal, of positioning Denmark as a pioneering nation, that must be self-sustainable, having the entire energy comsumption covered by renewable energysources by 2050 \cite{energipolitik_2020} requires much of the electricity infrastructure to be rethought, along with many of the usage patterns and habits in terms of electricity usage.


The long term increase in disposable income increases to leverage the availability of electrical appliances in Danish households %\cite{keylist}. 
The increase in energy consuming appliances can be split into both leisure-usage products, such as flat screen TV's gaming consoles, laptops etc. labeled \textit{wants}, and on the other hand white goods and other home appliances, aiding the busy family in their daily business, labeled \textit{needs}.

Stimulating and enforcing new habits in household-appliances like an oven or cooker (\textit{needs}), may enforce energy saving behavior. 
Visualizing actual usage and cost associated with \textit{standby-consumption} and \textit{leave-it-on-behavior}, and perhaps even awarding \textit{good habits}, when using TV's, Laptops etc. can probably affect a family's energy usage, and green focus in a positive way.

It is believed that visualizing a clear distinction between \textit{necessary} and \textit{leisure} usage of energy (\textit{needs} and \textit{wants}) may actually stimulate awareness and interest in the actual nature of the energy usage, and hereby generate a greater awareness and reduce the energy consumption.

The outcome of this article will try to present a framework for stimulation adoption of greener energy habits, paving the way for a technology prototype.

\subsection{Current and past efforts, supporting adoption of greener habits}
A number of initiatives, some only Danish, other common European, have been deployed to reduce both the general energy-usage, and in scope of this article, with specific focus on electricity. The former organization \textit{Elsparefonden} had a primary focus of saving electricity in private households along with the public sector, but has been succeeded by \textit{Go' energi} witha more broad focus on energysavings in general \cite{ing_elspar} 

\subsection{development of energyconsuming devices in households}

\section{Theoretical considerations}
Attempting to enforce new technology aided habits in a population can be described by models of technology adoption. 
Traditional approaches suggest that technology adopters gain interest in a product by acquiring it and assessing its application, hereby assimilating knowledge about it \cite{gilbert}.

\subsection{Rogers innovation adoption model}
Adoption of innovations, where innovations are defined as an idea, practice or object suited for adoption, is well described by Everett Rogers diffusion research.

\subsubsection{The five step innovation diffusion process}
Adopting an innovation requires a number of decisions. The decisions happens sequentially over time, and are by Rogers \cite{rogers_model}

\subsubsection{adopter categories}
Initially Rogers models \cite{rogers_model} operates with a model describing market penetration described bu an S curve, also known as the logistic function, ~\ref{fig:adoption}

This group is characterized by being the first individuals to adopt 
an innovation, thus this group represents only 2.5\% of the consumers \cite{diffusion2}. 
Innovators are typically members of the higher social classes, 
risk willing, has good financial lucidity, and are very social competent, 
often in close contact with other innovators. 
The innovators are seldom impacted by the fact the their risk-willingness results in an acquisition of a failed or faulty technology \cite{rogers_model} 
Innovator may even being wiling to use a technology prototype.  \\ % inserting body of the table
\hline

Early adopters & 
The early adopters are the second fastest group to adopt an innovation. What characterizes Early Adopters are a high degree of opinion leadership, compared to the other adopter groups. Innovators and early adopters are closely related in terms of education level, financial lucidity and social skills. Early adopters are a bit more judicious in their decission making regarding adoption of a new technology, compared to the innovators, thus seeking to adopt a somewhat mature technology. Their judicious approach often position early adopters in central communication positions, as opinion makers \cite{rogers_model}.
Early adopters make up about 13.5\% of the consumers \cite{diffusion2} \\
\hline

Early majority &  
This group, representing 34 \% of consumers \cite{diffusion2} are the careful consumers, avoiding the big risks, by relying on feedback from the early adopter group. 
This group seldom represents the opinion makers, but rely on feedback and recommendations from others. Their more awaiting approach to adoption results in a somewhat later time for adoption of emerging innovations\cite{rogers_model}.\\
\hline

Late majority & 
The late majority also represents app. 34\% of the consumers\cite{diffusion2}, but with a somewhat more skeptical approach. Here, only innovations that has became more common items are adopted. The late majority group is characterized, in general, by having below average social status, and only very little opinion leadership\cite{rogers_model}.\\
\hline

Laggards & 
Laggards are the remaining 16\% of customers trying to avoid changes and having to adopt new innovations. This group may not adopt a new innovation until traditional alternatives are no longer available  cs\cite{diffusion2}. Focus is very much on traditions, the group tends to have the highest age among adopters, lowest financial fluidity, and primarily only being in contact with close friends and family. Thus this group does not represent any opinion leadership\cite{rogers_model} \\

\textit{"There are potential uncovered needs, in visualizing energy consumption in real time, to enforce greener habits, among the groups, Innovators, Early Adopters and Early Majority, according to rogers model for innovation adoption."}

\textit{"Visualizing energy consumption in realtime, by means of IT aided solution, and focusing on potential savings, will enforce greener habits among the energy consumers"}

\textit{"By presenting a clear distinction between leisure and necessary usage, the consumer groups, capable of adopting this technology, will be able to adopt a greener mindset"}

\section{model}
By using Rogers models for technology diffusion and adoption, a framework will be established to asses the impact of energy saving campaigns the in the ?5 year? period 2006-2011.
The perspective applied is from an approach where the interest is to focus on IT aided solutions used to stimulate new greener habits among consumers.

Since the emerge of new IT aided technologies for communicating,  browsing the web, collecting data and communicating via social medias has experienced a massive growth the last decade, it will be a valid assumption that these technologies will play a central role in most Danish energy consumers everyday life.

This field, in particular the emerge of smartphones, combined with collective sensing and data-sharing presents a massive potential in terms of ability to collect, share and analyse data. Much of this relies on the continuous development and emerge of new technologies, thus models for adoption of new technology, in particular \textit{Everet Rogers } theory behind \textit{Diffusion of innovations will be used}.

Existing evaluation of present conducted campaigns and where possible evaluation of current activities, both with primary focus on electricity usage, will be analyzed.


\section{current and past initiatives}
Below the most significant, and regional initiatives, in Denmark across the last ?? years are outlined

\subsection{Energymarking of electric products}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{energy_mark.png}
\caption{\textit{EU's energymark}}			
\label{fig:emark} % is used to refer this table in the text
\end{figure}

The \textit{EU energy-mark} is mandatory for all producers and retailers of following household appliances: 
Fridge and freezers, Dishwashers, Washing-machines, Tumble-driers, Electric bulbs, Ovens, 
Air-conditioning and climate devices and Televisions.
The mark originally rates products from \textbf{A} to \textbf{G}, where \textbf{A} indicates the best energy efficiency. 
Additions allows \textbf{A+}, \textbf{A++} and \textbf{A+++} marking, if technology allows this. \cite{energymark}

The rating is relative, to the current technological availability, for instance regarding \textit{light-bulbs}, 
here the bulbs are compared to traditional incandescent lightbulbs, today an \textbf{A}-rated buld shall produce 4 times more \textit{Lumen} per \textit{Watt} than a similar incandescent type, emitting the same amount of light. For light  bulbs the energy mark also specifies the expected lifetime in \textit{hours}.

When buying new household appliances the \textit{energy-mark} is a good factual indication, that can be used to judge the
best energy efficiency, and thus biasing the customer to buy energy efficient products. 

A potential drawback of the energy mark, is the risk of a non-persistent "green-impact", since the \textit{energy-mark} 
primarily is to be used during purchase. History shows that technology and also energy efficiency improves over time, so the once purchased energymarked \textbf{A} fridge, might not be as efficient any more. The impact of the energy mark may also not affect the users behavior, once the purchase has been made.  

Preceding the \textit{energy-mark} is the \textit{Electricity-saving mark}, which essentially shows the efficiency of an electric household utility. The marking using categories \textbf{A} to \textbf{G} is similar for both marking systems. 
The \textit{Electricity-saving mark} had in 2009 achieved a level of customer awareness of 79 \%. The transition from \textit{Electricity-saving mark} to \textit{Energy-saving mark} has resulted in a little confusion among customers, thus the transparency, and similarity of both marks has made the transition relatively smooth. \cite{annual_ens_10}
The \textit{Energy-saving mark} is by customers perceived as a trustworthy tool, aiding purchase of energy efficient products \cite{keylist}.

The legislation regarding \textit{energy-marking of energy-related products} states that savings are to be achieved by informing the end user about consumption during usage, and other vital facts. \cite{energylaw1} Other vital facts could be emitted \textit{Lumens} and expected liftime in \textit{Hours} for a lightbulb.\newline 


\textbf{\textit{Keywords - efficiency, lifetime, standardization, harmonization, trustworthy.}}

\subsection{Go' Energi}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{enok.png}
\caption{\textit{Go' energi's native Eskimo}}			
\label{fig:enok} % is used to refer this table in the text
\end{figure}

Go' Energi is an independent state initiated campaign targeted at Danish House-owners, with the aim of informing about potential improvements within: indoor climate, comfort, energy economics and climate awareness \cite{goenergi}.

The campaign has selected an Eskimo, a member of the Greenlandic population as a symbol. The Eskimo symbolizes harmony with nature, passion and conscience for the nature and environment, and not least, the Eskimos has among any population, great skills and knowledge about keeping warm in a cold climate. Greenland 
is an autonomous country within the kingdom of Denmark, hereby the Danish population have some kind of relation to an Eskimo.  
\textit{"Keeping warm, in a conscious way"} is more or less the mindset the campaign aims to spread among the Danish house-owners. 

The campaign was established in 2010, and is led by \textit{Center For Energy-savings}, an organization founded by the Ministry of Climate- and Energy. Funding of the campaign and the organization is a tax of 0,006 DKK/KWh, paid by customers in the households and public sector. \textit{Center For Energy Saving} succeeds the former orginasation \textit{Elsparefonden}, who had a dedicated aim at saving electricity \cite{annual_ens_10}. 

Among the instruments used to promote energy improvements are following:

\textit{Selected product tests:} Selecting products of interest, and verifying whether or not they match their energy-mark rating. Few products, for example air-heat-pumps, have been much to optimistic rated in terms of energy-efficiency. By conducting sample tests, producers and retailers will gain increased awareness and attention to the specifications of the products they sell. Also this will have the benefit of sharpening discipline, to retain an energy-friendly and trustworthy brand in the relations between producers/retailers and customers.

\textit{Promoting the 20\% most energy efficient products:} Through assessing new product data and conducting tests ,the 20\% best performing products, in terms of energy efficiency, will be awarded the energy mark from \textit{Go energi}, indicating they provide a good energy performance. The \textit{Go energi} mark is hoped to gain the same trustworthy perception among customers as the \textit{EU enrgy-mark}. 

\textit{educational training targeted at resellers and craftsmen:} Campaigns are being conducted to educate and raise the knowledge of reseller-staff, thus 
improving their skills, concerning their ability to guide and advise consumers, regarding purchasing energy efficient products.
Also training targeted at craftsmen, such as carpenters and electricians, are conducted. This to leverage the ability of competent guidance, and presenting energy saving, well proved mature solutions, when renovating older buildings, or crafting new buildings \cite{annual_ens_11}.  

Besides from the above, \textit{Go energi} provides evaluations, tools, and training for other public sectors, institutions etc. beyond the scope of this \newline

\textbf{\textit{Keywords - inspiration, optimization, environmental conscience, targeted information, testing, recommendations.}}

\subsection{Behavioural campaign - "Chasing the hidden energy"}
Actually \textit{Chasing the hidden energy} campaign is targeted at public institutions, where the aim of this article is focused at private households. 

\textit{Chasing the hidden energy} asses the fact that approximately 50\% of energy-usage within the public sector is consumed by two equally energy-consuming groups of products, one being electric lights and the other being IT equipment and other electronic equipment\cite{bk_2004}.
It is argued that a massive saving potential, up to 20\%, can be realized, by changing behavior, in terms of acting responsible, turning of the lights, remembering to shut down PC's, coffee-machines, printers etc, at the end of the day. 
Further savings between 10\% and 25\% can be achieved by smaller investments in energy saving equipment, such as \textit{Auto-power-off electric sockets, led bulbs, etc.}\cite{hidden_e}. 

Changing behavior, rewarding achieved goals, setting the goals and gaining commitment all requires leadership, hence an emerging trend is \textit{Energy-leadership}. 

To perform successful energy-leadership following prerequisites are essential.

\textit{A clear visualization of the current energy use :} In order to achieve goals, and being able to track the results of ongoing efforts, it is vital to have as clear intuitive visual presentation of the energy usage.
 
\textit{A clear strategy :} Formulate a clear strategy that all \textit{members of the community} can support, this can be employees, residents in a local housing association, or just your family members. The strategy should formulate few ambitious, but realistic achievable goals. 

\textit{Commitment :} Strategy and visualization can only become operational and useful if the participants are committed, motivated, and can associate with the goals. An ambassador should be appointed, in an institution, preferably a non-formal employee, a person that has respect among colleagues, and also possess social skills. Relating to \textit{Rogers segmentation of technology adoption groups}, the ambassador should be in the \textit{Early Majority} segment, thus enjoying respect from the somewhat more conservative \textit{Late Majority} and \textit{Laggards}. If the ambassador is to fuzzy and has the characteristics of an \textit{Innovator}, commitment the late segments may be hard to achieve. 

Commitment can be realized by rewarding good behavior, this can be small things like \textit{"the boss buys cake when all printers and light have been turned off for two weekends"} or perhaps state that 5\% of the annual saving are used to fund an event like a summer-party 

The effect of an energy-campaign in a company is believed to have a mutual positive effect on the participants energy-habits in their homes\cite{hidden_e}. Energy-leadership can easily be scaled down and applied in private households. \newline

\textbf{\textit{Keywords - leadership, reward, visualize, smartness.}}


\subsection{Se' elforbrug}
Se-elforbrug is a web-tool, mandatory for public institutions and optional for factories and other larger electricity consumers. The tool prerequisites that the installation is equipped with remote-read energy meters \cite{see}. 
Once participating, the tools monitors consumption on an hourly basis, and presents graphs and trends in the consumption. Consumption can be grouped based on affiliation, and compared to other similar users, e.g. \textit{schools} can comped against each other, in realizing the lowest energy usage.
Companies, municipalities or other institutions that commits to a reduction in energy-usage or Co2 emission can visualize their real-time data to the public, thus committing to their obligations.

Similar initiatives are emerging availible to the private customer, with a \textit{smart-meter} equipped installation. For instance \textit{Energi-midt} have developed a smartphone app. capable of displaying historical electricity usage, with an hourly granularity \cite{em_app}. \newline

\textbf{\textit{Keywords - data-collection, optimization, compare, commitment, real-time data.}}
