% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{./figures/}}

%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
A 90\% reduction in the emission of climate gases, is the ambitious Danish goal, presented to achieve the maximum temperature rise of 2$\,^{\circ}$C  in the global average temperature. This goal cannot solely be achieved by increasing energy taxes and optimizing energy usage, a vital mean to reduction is energy awareness. 

This article asseses the opportunity to visualize energy consumption in typical households. A clear distinguishing between mandatory and leisure usage, is believed to reinforce greener habits, when presented clear and intuitive.

\textit{Keywords - awareness, visualization, smart metering, greener habits}
\end{abstract}

\section{scope}
This article is written as part of the publications within the Ecosense project. The Ecosense project is a collaboration between several Danish universities, companies and foreign research institutions. 

The common emphasis is on visualizing the individuals energy habits, and impact on the environment, aiming at reinforcing new and greener habits. 

The Ecosense project is funded by the Danish Strategic Research Council with 18 millions.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Electricity has become a necessity in all developed countries, not only in Denmark on which this article focuses. Yet with fluctuating production prices, due to a growing share being produced by renewable sources, and a long term trend of an annual increase of approximately 5 \% \cite{udv_elpriser}, still private households acounts for 20\% of the total electricity consumption in Denmark \cite{energistat}.
The danish governments ambitious goal Denmark being a pioneering nation, that must be self-sustainable, having the entire energy comsumption covered by renewable energysources by 2050 \cite{energipolitik_2020} 

The long term increase in disposable income increases to leverage the availability of electrical appliances in Danish households %\cite{keylist}. 

The increase in energy consuming appliances can be split into both leisure-usage products, such ad flat screen TV's gmaing consoles, laptops etc. labeled \textit{wants}, and on the other hand white goods and other home appliances, aiding the busy family in their daily business, labeled \textit{needs}.

.....Argue that visualization og the actual energy usage, and the distribution between \textit{needs} and \textit{wants} may actuallty stimulate awareness and interest in the actual energy usage.

...will try to present a framework for stimulation adoption of greener energy habits.1




\subsection{Current and past efforts, supporting adoption of greener habits}

\subsection{development of energyconsuming devices in households}

\section{Theoretical considerations}
Attempting to enforce new technology aided habits in a population can be described by models of technology adoption. 
Traditional approaches suggest that technology adopters gain interest in a product by acquiring it and assessing its application, hereby assimilating knowledge about it \cite{gilbert}.

Adoption of innovations, where innovations are defined as an idea, practice or object suited for adoption, is well described by Everett Rogers diffusion research.
Initially Rogers models \cite{rogers} operates with a model describing market penetration described bu an S curve, also known as the logistic function.

Innovators &			%new line
This group is characterized by being the first individuals to adopt 
an innovation, thus this group represents only 2.5\% of the consumers \cite{diffusion2}. 
Innovators are typically members of the higher social classes, 
risk willing, has good financial lucidity, and are very social competent, 
often in close contact with other innovators. 
The innovators are seldom impacted by the fact the their risk-willingness results in an acquisition of a failed or faulty technology \cite{rogers_model} 
Innovator may even being wiling to use a technology prototype.  \\ % inserting body of the table
\hline

Early adopters & 
The early adopters are the second fastest group to adopt an innovation. What characterizes Early Adopters are a high degree of opinion leadership, compared to the other adopter groups. Innovators and early adopters are closely related in terms of education level, financial lucidity and social skills. Early adopters are a bit more judicious in their decission making regarding adoption of a new technology, compared to the innovators, thus seeking to adopt a somewhat mature technology. Their judicious approach often position early adopters in central communication positions, as opinion makers \cite{rogers_model}.
Early adopters make up about 13.5\% of the consumers \cite{diffusion2} \\
\hline

Early majority &  
This group, representing 34 \% of consumers \cite{diffusion2} are the careful consumers, avoiding the big risks, by relying on feedback from the early adopter group. 
This group seldom represents the opinion makers, but rely on feedback and recommendations from others. Their more awaiting approach to adoption results in a somewhat later time for adoption of emerging innovations\cite{rogers_model}.\\
\hline

Late majority & 
The late majority also represents app. 34\% of the consumers\cite{diffusion2}, but with a somewhat more skeptical approach. Here, only innovations that has became more common items are adopted. The late majority group is characterized, in general, by having below average social status, and only very little opinion leadership\cite{rogers_model}.\\
\hline

Laggards & 
Laggards are the remaining 16\% of customers trying to avoid changes and having to adopt new innovations. This group may not adopt a new innovation until traditional alternatives are no longer available  cs\cite{diffusion2}. Focus is very much on traditions, the group tends to have the highest age among adopters, lowest financial fluidity, and primarily only being in contact with close friends and family. Thus this group does not represent any opinion leadership\cite{rogers_model} \\
